# LEASE-SMART

For some reason, I've always thought leases were "dumb" - I always thought they were a waste of money.
Turns out, that was a silly assumption. Sometimes, they are a good move depending on the numbers. 
This silly little web app is designed to help you figure out if leasing is a good move for you.

You can access it at shouldilease.noahalex.dev
